# Random Teleporting (RTP)

We offer a random teleport feature to easily get into the world and discover new locations. RTP always chooses surface locations and is designed to prevent choosing locations that are dangerous (i.e. above a lava pool, in the middle of the ocean, etc.). RTPs are available in the [main smp world](broken-reference) and [resource world](resource-world.md) and work slightly differently.

{% hint style="success" %}
For new players the first RTP will be free of charge.
{% endhint %}

To RTP, run **`/rtp`** twice, first to open the confirmation dialogue, and again to confirm.
