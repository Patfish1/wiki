# Extra game sounds

The server features a bunch of additional sounds using existing MC sounds with adjusted pitch and volume to enhance the gameplay experience. If you wish, you can turn these sounds off using the[ profile menu](../../general/profile-and-customization/). Most sounds emit within a radius like regular sounds, meaning nearby players will also be able to hear sounds created by you. Note that disabling hearing the sounds does not stop you from emitting them.\
