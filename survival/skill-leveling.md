# Skill Leveling

As you play, you'll be able to level up skills in nine areas: mining, armory, combat, farming, woodcutting, exploration, fishing, alchemy, and enchanting. Each skill has its own set of unique abilities that become more powerful as you work your way to skill mastery. Not only will leveling up your skills give you access to these skill abilities, but they will also contribute to 4 core stats: vigor (strength), defense (damage reduction), agility (speed), and wisdom (skill and mc xp absorbance).

You can open the skills menu using **`/skills`**
