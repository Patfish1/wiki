## Connection Location

To help build a sense of global connection and make juggling timezones easier, the server displays your country (estimated from your IP address) when you log in. Itâ€™s a simple way to show where our members are from and to highlight others from your region. Your actual IP address is never publicly shown!

We respect your privacy, while there is currently no built in toggle system for join country, members can have the message hidden per request - no questions asked, just contact staff!

## Membership Length

When logging in, the amount of days since you first joined vibe as well as the associated Season is displayed to give others a sense of how long you've been around the community.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can view the exact join time, date, and Season of you or another online player on demand using the `/firstjoin [username]` command
{% endhint %}
